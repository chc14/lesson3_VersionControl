## Assignment Date:  
(Februrary 2, 2017)

## Student Name:  
(Colin Creedon)

## Project Description:
(In this assignment, I was introduced to the version control system Git. Git is where I will upload all project files to and view changes over time.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned how to configure my Cloud9 account with GitHub. By doing this I will be able to upload projects and files to my GitHub account.)
2. (In this assignment I spent a lot of time on the Git website learning about repositories. While doing so, I created my first repository for Lesson3. I eventually pushed these files into the GitHub.)
3. (Version control sytems, repositories, and basic commands were all extremely important pieces to learn in this lesson. I became familiar with the VCS and how Git in itself is one. VCS's will allow me to use repositories to upload files.)
