            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS is an acronym for a Version Control System. The main thing to understand about this system is what exactly version control means. Version control has one main repository for all the projects needed. You can take out file out of the system, do whatever you deem necessary, and send it back in with those changes taking effect. The main and most helpful effect of this system is that it solves the file sharing issues. When changes are made, the VCS will give information on who, when, and what changes were made. After noting all of this information, the system will merge the changes to the file. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Information stored in a data structure is considered to be a repository. For instance, Gits job is to hold projects for users over time as they make changes. You might wonder where the information is held while changes are being made. That is where the repository comes into play. There are two types of repositories: local and remote. A local repository resides on the machine of the user using it, like the computer I am currently using. A remote repository is shared on a server instead of a machine and can be used by users that connect to the server. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of version control system that is free and open for users to use such as myself. In a class such as Web Applications Development, any type of project can be handled by Git. One of the most outstanding features about Git is the haste of the system. This speed helps students and users get projects done without having to wait for long amounts of time for a project to load, transfer, etc. Everything on Git is local, so instead of needing one device to do every piece of work on, you could use any and connect locally. And all of the repository data that is generated such as multiple files, the user will get their own copy of each. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">VCS Advantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The version control system comes with a substantial amount of benefits. One described in highlight 2 was that many file sharing issues were solved by installing the system; however, there are many others. Files on the system can never be overwritten, so if a change is made, that new file will be stored as well. This is beneficial so you can see all of the changes over time and will not lose any of the previous projects. For instance, say some of your changes you change your mind about and would like to go back a couple weeks ago and take your old file. The VCS makes this possible. The system is quite easy to understand, and clearly extremely helpful. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many Git commands that are needed to do different things. GIT LOG shows all of the backups created in the repository you are in. So say you wanted to see the files that have been pushed into that repository, you could use GIT LOG. GIT STATUS will do something somewhat similar, showing which files were changed last and which new ones have been added. GIT BLAME_ sounds sort of straight forward, it will tell you who wrote which file. GIT DIFFERENCE also straight forward, showing the difference between previous codes and the current code. All in all, in Git you add new changes, bring them to the staging area to commit them, then push them from the local repository to the remote repository. </p>
